Password Generator

## User Story 
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data

I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Functionality 

* The user first arrives at the webpage 
* the user will then enter the desired number of characters long the password will be 
* the user should then click the 'Generate Password" button
* 4 prompts will appear asking if the user would like to:
use lower case characters
use upper case characters
use special characters
use numerical characters
* if the user decides to reject all of them they will reset the cycle and will need to start from clicking the 'Generate Password' button again
* once the user has decided which characters they would like to have included the randomly generated password will appear in the text box 
* the user will then be able to copy the random password to their clipboard by clicking the 'Copy to Clipboard' button
